                <h4 class="guide-subheading">unspoken rules</h4>
                <p>Difficulties in finding an apartment in Shanghai may make you feel you are drowning in trying to fit in to your new city. But as a matter of fact, you join everyone who are equally as confused and tired when it comes to finding a new apartment to rent. A majority of the confusion and difficulty actually doesnâ€™t have anything to do with you, but instead comes down to unspoken and hidden customs and practices that only industry insiders know or people who have been through it before can only tell you.

                <h4 class="guide-subheading">The pool is deeper than you can see</h4>
                <p>Often people say that in Shanghai property market, the pond is deeper than it looks when you put your foot in it. Whether you are a foreigner or local it will be the same issues when it comes to deciding how to find an apartment and also evaluating the the rental price compared to your budget. Therefore, its best to find someone who you can trust, and most of the time the best solution is to get some great recommendations from people who have been there and done that.

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h4 class="guide-subheading">searching for recommendations</h4>
                <p>The best source for finding things is from a trusted source of information. When it comes to rentals, we depend on word of mouth recommendations and sometimes tads of information that we hear through the grapevine. Finding your apartment and just relying on an agent is often like walking down a road blindfolded. So when you start your search, a good place to begin is with the people you have around you and ask for their resources, experiences, and who helped them out in their time of need.

                <p>There is a huge variety of room types in Shanghai with every price point catered for in the marketplace. Which room you will able to afford will obviously depend on your choice of neighborhood, size and budget. One bedroom and two bedroom apartments are prevalent in most neighborhoods and are the norm. With three bedroom apartments, these are less common but are rather concentrated in large luxury complexes and service apartment buildings. These apartments can be quite affordable if you have one or more roommates that you can share the costs with. Also, quite distinct to Shanghai are villas and old lane houses and in most cases are renovated in keeping with modern designs. These abodes are normally priced at a premium as they are in demand and in short supply. Finally, there are houses and villas that are equivalent to a house which are priced the highest but with the most livable area compared to all the other types.

                <p>When it comes to picking your apartment, it is important to be realistic and consider your budget. And in many cases, where you can afford will depend on which neighborhood you choose to live in. As a good rule of thumb, the closer to the CBD such as Jingan, Xintiandi and the bund will be more expensive than neighborhoods that are further out.

Shanghai is one of the most walkable cities and its quite enjoyable to walk through different streets and seeing what is going on. Try and wander around the French concession or the old shanghai lane ways and it might be during those moments that you will find where you belong as Shanghai quietly speaks to you.

                <h4 class="guide-subheading">What is a "fee" ("commission fee/broker fee")?<br></h4>
                <p>A fee is the dollar amount owed to an agent when he or she helps you find an apartment. The fee can range from 8 percent to 15 percent of the full year's lease. If the agent says the fee is one month's rent, that's the same as saying it's 8.3 percent of the full year's lease. One month = 8.3 percent of 12 months.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="guide-subheading">Finding an apartment without paying a fee</h5>
                <p>There are two ways to avoid a fee. 1) You go straight to landlords and find an apartment without the help of an agent. Or you can use an agent whose fee is paid by the landlord on your behalf.</p>

                    The French Concession, the former French colonial possession, is today a charming, historic district known for its European architecture and tree-lined streets, as well as its shopping, bars and cafes. Most of the action centers on the main east-west thoroughfare, Huaihai Road, an upscale shopping destination. You can also tour the area around Dongping Road, where dozens of the city's hottest bars are active nightly. Shopping in the area is a bit overpriced, but you'll find unique, one-of-a-kind items here that may be worth the money.</p>
